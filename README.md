This is my try on developing a remote control for the VESC based on the arduino platform.

This piece of software in licensed under GNU GPL v3, so you can work with it as you please.

## Be careful
there is no warranty or whatsoever, that this software won't harm or try to kill you.
Always wear protection when riding an electric board and be prepared to jump off.

This software is under active development.
I have not been able to ride it, so please don't attempt to do so.

## Help and Ideas (contribution)
If you want to help and contribute feel free to do so. I love every piece of advice since i' not a professional programmer.

   Without his great piece of work, the VESC, i wouldn't have this repository (or even a DIY E-Board)

   The first proper UART connection for the VESC! You helped me a lot understanding UART. 
   In the future i will rewrite the library for my needs, but never forget where the base came from.

   This is porn! Great library, fast, and the documentation is phenomenal. With every function explained it's easy to customize your code. 
   There are also a lot of good examples. I never had a WIFI module before, this makes the entry so easy.

   His rewrite of the TFT library is super fast and easy to understand and configureable. Everything is well thought and the comments always tell you what a choice will affect (speed and size).
